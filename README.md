# get_things_done_with_react

**React** is out there for us, so let's use it to **get things done**.

This is a starting, work-in-progress application inspirated by a method that one of my teachers proposed us to overcome unproductivity and see real work at the end of the day.

Each day at the begining of your work session define all the tasks that you would like to accomplish that day. Then check them one by one, as long as you finished them and watch your list getting smaller and smaller and your shoulders lightweight.

If you get everything done, please offer yourself a reward and enjoy the rest of your day.


### In this early stage you can:
* Insert new tasks
* Check/Uncheck them
